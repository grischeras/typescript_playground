# Extra credit:

# len()
# is build-in function, return the number of chars as a int value , only if the parameter is not an int or float literals. String, variable, list, dict, etc.
# len(111) >>> TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()
# len ('111') 
# >>> 3
# x = '1111'
# y = len (x)
# y 
# >>> 4

# round()
# is build-in function too, takes 2 arguments (parameters) round( 'float' , 'how many digit return')
# ex. 
# round(100.111 , 3) 
# >>> 100.111
# round(100.11 , 2) 
# >>> 100.11
# round(100.1 , 1) 
# >>> 100.1
